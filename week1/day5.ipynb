      "What is Work Placement?\n",
      "The completion of work placement is critical to the success of your qualification. Not only do all of ACFPT courses have a mandatory work placement component but it also provides our students with the opportunity to learn in a real environment under the direction of a qualified practitioner.\n",
      "Work placement provides you with the opportunity to:\n",
      "Work with adolescent and adult clients in an operational fitness industry environment such as a gym or fitness centre.\n",
      "Work with other fitness professionals to support the needs of adolescent and adult clients.\n",
      "Develop relationships and networks with colleagues and the community\n",
      "Work placement is often the first step to securing employment in the fitness industry following the completion of your qualification.\n",
      "The following hours apply to our qualifications:\n",
      "SIS30321 Certificate III in Fitness – 40 hours\n",
      "SIS40221 Certificate IV in Fitness – 60 hours\n",
      "SIS40221 Certificate IV in Fitness Fast Track – 100 hours\n",
      "SIS30321 + SIS40221 Dual Qualification in Fitness – 100 hours\n",
      "HLT33021 Certificate III in Allied Health Assistance – 120 hours\n",
      "Many graduates of ACFPT have gone on to secure full and part-time employment with their vocational placement employers and continue their studies to grow their career.\n",
      "When can I start my Work Placement?\n",
      "Work placement can be completed at any time throughout the duration of your enrolment. However, if you are not currently working in the industry, work placement will generally commence once you have successfully completed the theory components of at least the first six (6) units of competency.\n",
      "Before you commence your work placement you and your workplace supervisor will be required to sign a number of documents. Please note, you must not commence placement until these documents are signed.\n",
      "ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF WORKPLACE I SHOULD SOURCE?\n",
      "There are some restrictions on the type of workplace you choose. ACFPT approves the following workplaces:\n",
      "Work placement must be completed in one of the following:\n",
      "Local gyms\n",
      "Commercial fitness centres\n",
      "Sporting clubs\n",
      "Personal training studios\n",
      "Home based facilities\n",
      "Work placement facilities must meet the requirements for equipment and supervision detailed in the work placement checklist.\n",
      "Where the facility is unable to supply all equipment, some tasks may be completed using improvised resources.\n",
      "TIPS FOR FINDING WORK PLACEMENT\n",
      "It’s important to get your search for work placement off to a great start. Make contact with a range of fitness facilities in your local area or an area that you can travel to. You may wish to become a member at a facility to increase your chances of securing the ideal placement. Use the following tips to help you secure your placement organisation:\n",
      "Research fitness facilities in your local area or an area that you can travel to\n",
      "Conduct research on the fitness facility before you speak to them. Employers always like to see that potential staff have taken the time to get to know their organisation\n",
      "Consider your search as a job interview and prepare a detailed application for the fitness facility\n",
      "Ensure that you sell yourself including your professional qualities, any previous experience and your career aspirations\n",
      "Make sure that your applications are tailored to the fitness facility you want to work with\n",
      "When speaking with potential workplaces, don’t be afraid to sell yourself\n",
      "When you secure your placement, work hard and aim to achieve positive results for yourself and the organisation\n",
      "Last but not least, in your search, ensure you find the organisation that shares your values\n",
      "Not sure where to start? Check out our Job Opportunities page to fund gyms near you offering work placement and career opportunities.\n",
      "Job Opportunities\n",
      "AT THE INTERVIEW\n",
      "Prepare well in advance of your interview by preparing the questions you want answered in advance and updating your resume. While you are there:\n",
      "Be positive and aware of your posture and body language\n",
      "Let them know what you know about their organisation/facility\n",
      "Speak to your resume including your achievements\n",
      "Respond to any questions positively\n",
      "WHAT IF I AM HAVING TROUBLE FINDING PLACEMENT?\n",
      "ACFPT offers a free service for all of our current students to support them to find a suitable work placement facility. We can help you with:\n",
      "Providing advice on preparing your resume\n",
      "On-site insurance requirements\n",
      "Referring students to known workplaces seeking volunteers. Contact your trainer\n",
      "Before you do your interview, you’ll be provided with a work placement letter that you can give to the facility to confirm that you are currently enrolled in a vocational qualification requiring the completion of a mandatory work placement.\n",
      "Contact us to find out more and inquire about the work placement conditions.\n",
